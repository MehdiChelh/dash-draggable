import plotly.express as px
import pandas as pd

app = dash.Dash(__name__)

df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/gapminderDataFiveYear.csv')

app.layout = html.Div([
    # -- Dash draggable
    dash_draggable.DashDraggable(
        id='draggable',
        children=[
            dcc.Graph(
                id='graph-with-slider',
                responsive=True,
                style=dict(height='100%', width='100%')),
            dcc.Slider(
                id='year-slider',
                min=df['year'].min(),
                max=df['year'].max(),
                value=df['year'].min(),
                marks={str(year): str(year) for year in df['year'].unique()},

])


# Callback for the graph
@app.callback(
    Output('graph-with-slider', 'figure'),
    Input('year-slider', 'value'))
def update_figure(selected_year):
    filtered_df = df[df.year == selected_year]

    fig = px.scatter(filtered_df, x="gdpPercap", y="lifeExp",
                     size="pop", color="continent", hover_name="country",
                     log_x=True, size_max=55)

    fig.update_layout(transition_duration=500)

    return fig
